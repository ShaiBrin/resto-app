        "Step into the smoky embrace of JAGY's Smokehouse BBQ & Grillade at our Coral Springs location on 2660 North University Drive. Nestled in the vibrant heart of Coral Springs, we're just a stone’s throw from local favorites like Coral Springs Craft Brewery, Funky Buddha, and Big Bear Brewing, whose brews often grace our taps.",
        "This spot has a storied past—built in 1958 as a warehouse for a local citrus shipping company, it later housed a custom furniture workshop before we fired up our grills in July 2015. The rustic brick walls still echo that history, now paired with the aroma of slow-cooked BBQ.",
        "Our menu caters to all, with Gluten-Free, Vegan, and Vegetarian delights—ask our friendly staff for options. Beat the rush by reserving a table via OpenTable, or bring your crew—parties of 12 or more can book our private Smokeroom, complete with a full bar, buffet-style feasts, and seating for up to 50.",
        "At JAGY's, everyone’s welcome, including your well-mannered pups, who can join you on our shaded outdoor patio."
